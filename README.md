# 001-Public

The source code for a  discord bot I'm currently writing.
You can run it yourself, but it's pretty user specific, so you will need to edit the [index.js](https://github.com/TheBozzz34/001-Public/index.js)

## Todo:
 - Command handler(WIP)
 - More commands 

Note: This is not the actual code repo running the bot, this is only a public mirror.
